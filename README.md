# ReactJS Hotels Library

This is a ReactJS application which lets you add a hotel with basic information, descriptiona and image. It is saved on the NodeJS server.

Flux architecture is used for the whole application. I've created a simple authentication (register and log in). React Router 4 lets you access the details page of the hotels where you can leave your ratings and comments.

### Instructions for installation
1. Run the NodeJS server with "node index.js" in the cmd (localhost: 5000)
2. In the project folder run "npm install" to install all the necessary packages
3. Run "npm start" and the app will start in your default browser
